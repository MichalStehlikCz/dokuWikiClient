# DokuWiki Client

Simple client for dokuWiki wikipedia, using XML-RPC to retrieve and put content on wiki. Goal is to support generating content to provys-wiki, even though it should not contain anything specific to this wikipedia (all specific stuff should be in wikiloader project).

Tests have hardcoded reference to test wiki and associated account; should be parametrized if it is to be reused somewhere else...
